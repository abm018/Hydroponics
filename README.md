      Completed work
      ---------------
            1. Training a neural network to identify which nutrient a lettuce plant is lacking with the help of TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
            2. To identify how much nutrient is lacking.
            3. To fit a model using logistic regression to predict how much macro/micro-nutrient the plant should take in a daily/weekly basis.
